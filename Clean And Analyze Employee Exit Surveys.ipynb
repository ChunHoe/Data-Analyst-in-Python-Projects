    "Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?\n",
    "Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?\n",
    "They want us to combine the results for both surveys to answer these questions. However, although both used the same survey template, one of them customized some of the answers. In the guided steps, we'll aim to do most of the data cleaning and get you started analyzing the first question.\n",

We'll help you fill in missing values in the dissatisfied column and then aggregate the data to get you started, but note that we still have additional missing values left to deal with. This is meant to be an initial introduction to the analysis, not the final analysis.\n",

Methods such as the df.pivot_table() method actually treat Boolean values as integers, so a True value is considered to be 1 and a False value is considered to be 0. That means that we can aggregate the dissatisfied column and calculate the number of people in each group, the percentage of people in each group, etc."
